About pybibtex
--------------

pybibtex is a drop-in replacement for the program bibtex and
bibtex-style files. It uses the same data base format and is
called in the same way. Just replace calls to "bibtex" with
"pybib" in your compile scripts and you are good to go.

bibtex's style files are written in an ancient language called
m4, which no one knows anymore. pybibtex allows one to define
citation styles using simple Python code. The user just
has to implement a function for each reference type.

A simple formatting function for the article type would be:

def article(bibentry):
  s = "%(author)s, %(journal)s {\\bf %(volume)s}, %(pages)s (%(year)s)"\
      % bibentry
  if "note" in bibentry: s += ", %(note)s" % bibentry
  return s+"."

pybibtex consists of the package with the same name and the program
pybib which calls the tools in the package. Usage instructions are given
below.

Installation
------------

Copy pybib into a directory listed in the PATH environment variable.
Copy pybibtex into a directory listed in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

pybibtex only depends on the Python standard library.

Usage
